You can see **iPython Jupyter Notebook** examples [here](./mean-median-mode.ipynb)

# Mean

- Arithmetic Average
- Sum / number of samples

example:  
Number of children in each house on my street:  
> 0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0  

mean = (0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0) / 9 = **1.11**

# Median

- Sort the values, and take the value at the midpoint.

Example:

> 0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0  

sort it:

> 0, 0, 0, 0, **1**, 2, 2, 2, 3

median = **1**

# Mode

- The most common value in a data set
- Not relevant to continuous numerical data

example:

> 0, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0

How many of each value are there?

> 0: appears 4 times   
> 1: appears 1 times   
> 2: appears 3 times   
> 3: appears 1 times 

mode = **0**
